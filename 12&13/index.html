<h3>Week 12&13: Pool Testing and Cupholders</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Week 13
This week was our last work week. We did some final sanding on the epoxy runs on the side of the boat and cut out more of the seat supports, as we plan to make two seats and add a lawn or beach chair to the middle. We also made plans for cup holders and tested out different colors of paints and tints.

Week 12
This week, we tested out our boats on Blodgett Pool! We carefully loaded up the boats onto cars and moved them into the pool. Surprisingly, there were no leaks to cover up with epoxy, and our boat could hold about 5 people! We noticed how flimsy the bottom of the boat was, and we also needed to reinforce the sides of the boat more. Our boat was stable enough to stand in, sit on a bench, sit on the bottom of the floor, and even lay down to take a nap. All we need are the seats, some cup holders, and our detachable flag pole!
